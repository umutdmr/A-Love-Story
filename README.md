# A-Love-Story
Cmpe250 Fall'21 Project3
## This project is about graphs. It has two parts:
### First part is about finding the shorted path. I used Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm with adjacency list representation of graph.
### Second part is about finding the minimum spaning tree. I used Kruskal algorithm for finding that.
